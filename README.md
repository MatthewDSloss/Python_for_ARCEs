# ARCE Python
Through a series of Jupyter Notebooks, this repository aims to help students navigate Python for the first time by accompanying them through the labs presented in ARCE 352. There are two sets of notebooks:
## Pre-Lab
The pre-lab notebooks contain instruction on the Python semantics, libraries, and concepts needed to effectively complete each lab. The objective is to couple new knowledge in Python with existing knowledge in structural engineering such that students can focus on the applications of programming without spending their time sifting through documentation and struggling with debugging. These notebooks include generalized code snippets to demonstrate ideas as well as annotated partial solutions.

## Post-Lab
The post-lab notebooks contain an annotated set of solutions, recognizing that there are a multitued of approaches to both engineering and programming problems. Students are to be encouraged to explore Python on their own, with notebooks serving as a launching-point for further investigation.
